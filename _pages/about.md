I'm Fraser Goldsworth, an oceanographer currently based at the University of Oxford in the UK. This is my academic website, and here you'll find information about my research interests, publications, CV, and contact details.

Research interests
======
My research interests span almost the entire breadth of physical oceanography. I specialise in high-resolution numerical modelling of sub-mesoscale phenomena, but am particularly interested in how these processes impact larger mesoscale and global scale current systems. My PhD thesis focuses on the interaction between symmetric instability and various western boundary current systems in the Atlantic; these currents being important components of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. My thesis contains chapters on the North Brazil Current, the deep western boundary current as it crosses the equator and the high lattitude Irminger Current. I also enjoy using simplified toy models to explain the essential dynamics of these systems.

As well as my purely scientific work, I'm very passionate about open-science, open-source software, and EDI issues.

Hobbies
======
Outside the realm of academia, I'm a keen sailor. I've raced boats ranging from 12 ft to 40 ft in length and can often be found out on the water.
