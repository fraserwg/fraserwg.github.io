excerpt: 'Density staircases have been observed throughout the global ocean and are thought to be important in regulating vertical mixing. We observe density staircases in an idealised model of a deep western boundary current crossing the equator. We propose that the staircases are generated by the excitement of symmetric instability as the current crosses the equator. Symmetric instability generates overturning cells which causes the inhomogenous mixing of waters with different densities. The mixing barriers and well mixed regions in temperature profiles, coincide respectively with the boundaries and centres of the overturning cells generated by the symmetric instability.'

Density staircases are observed in an idealised model of a deep western boundary current upon crossing the equator. We propose that the staircases are generated by the excitement of symmetric instability as the current crosses the equator. The latitude at which symmetric instability is excited can be predicted using simple scaling arguments. Symmetric instability generates overturning cells which, in turn, cause the inhomogenous mixing of waters with different densities. The mixing barriers and well mixed regions in density profiles coincide, respectively, with the boundaries and centres of the overturning cells generated by the symmetric instability. This new mechanism for producing density staircases may require us to re-evaluate the origins of some of the density staircases observed in the Tropical Atlantic.
