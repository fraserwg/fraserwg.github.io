title: "Density staircases generated by symmetric instability in a cross-equatorial deep western boundary current"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-density-staircases
excerpt: 'Density staircases are observed in an idealized model of a deep western boundary current upon crossing the equator. We propose that the staircases are generated by the excitement of symmetric instability as the current crosses the equator. The latitude at which symmetric instability is excited can be predicted using simple scaling arguments. Symmetric instability generates overturning cells which, in turn, cause the inhomogenous mixing of waters with different densities. The mixing barriers and well mixed regions in density profiles coincide, respectively, with the boundaries and centers of the overturning cells generated by the symmetric instability. This new mechanism for producing density staircases may require us to re-evaluate the origins of some of the density staircases observed in the Tropical Atlantic.'
