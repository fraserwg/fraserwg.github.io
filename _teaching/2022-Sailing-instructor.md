I'm a qualified RYA sailing instructor and have taught students of all ages (from 6 to almost 75). I also designed and taught the introduction to navigational theory course run by Oxford University Yacht Club. Topics covered include tidal calculations and theory, meteorology, and mathematics for navigation.
