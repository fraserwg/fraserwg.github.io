I supervised Hayat Nasirova, a masters student from the University of Bremen, during a year long internship. We were exploring how symmetric instability in the cross-equatorial North Brazil Current manifests itself in the ICON-Ocean model run at various different resolutions.

Hayat is now pursuing a PhD in Stockholm, Sweden.
